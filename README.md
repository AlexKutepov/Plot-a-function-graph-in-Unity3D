## About

The Plot a function in Unity 3D had been made when 
I was searching for the solution for plotting a graph in Unity 3d and had not found it.

## Instruction

The target language was Russian, but
ver 0.3 has been translated into English 

and has been added TextMeshPro.

The system is using lablary - UnityEngine.UI.Extensions, so you shoud use a version of Unity3D that can using the lablary.

The basic cofiguration for the grahp:

looks like this:

The graph can be negative if you will set for the "Size Step x or y" to a negative value,
it looks like:

If you will want the function graph is non-linear, you will shoud add many points next to each other.

You can create your own a method for add points, so it will be more convenient.

You can resize the graph however you want, just change the rect transform before how you will start the project.
