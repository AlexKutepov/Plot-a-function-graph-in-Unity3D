## Plot a function graph in Unity3D

The target language was Russian, but
ver 0.3 has been translated into English 

and has been added TextMeshPro.

This system uses lablary UnityEngine.UI.Extensions, so you need to use a version of Unity3D  that can use this lablary.

Basic cofiguration for the grahp:

look like this:

Graph can be negative if you set for the "Size Step x or y" to a negative value,
look like:

If you want the  function graph is non-linear, you will must add many  points next to each other.

You can create your own a method for add points, so it will be more convenient.

You can resize the graph however you want, just do a rect transform before how you  start the project.
